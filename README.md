# deep_m_learning
A collection of jupyter notebooks kernels as taught at Udacity's deep learning nano degree program

The notebooks cover  **RNN** implementation to generate TV scripts from Simpson series dataset episodes, a **GAN** implementation to generate human faces and a **LSTM** to predict movies review sentiment. Both **RNN** and **GAN** are implemented in Tensorflow. **LSTM** implemented in PyTorch, trained and deployed with Amazon Sagemaker
